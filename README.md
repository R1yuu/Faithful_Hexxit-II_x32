# Install
To install just download the .zip from the latest "Release" and insert it into your resourcepack folder.
I recommend using Faithful x32 1.12.2 underneath it as base, as it is not included in this resourcepack.\
Faithful x32 1.12.2: <https://faithful.team/faithful-1-12/>

The release version will not include the `SPRITES` directory.

# Sprites Directory
Everything in the `SPRITES` directory was customary added for this resourcepack in particular with all of them being created by me or contributors.
